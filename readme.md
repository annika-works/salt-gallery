# Welcome to our Gallery Project! 

This is a React-based project, and part of an extensive three month Full-Stack Javascript Development Course at the School of Applied Technology Stockholm. 

The Gallery is connected to the Unsplash API and allows a user to look for images based on searchwords. Images are limited to 10 per page. Pagination at the bottom of the page fetches more images from the API. When hovering over the images, the author, metatags and Instagram handle of the photographer appear in a flipcard effect.
